									<p>National School Games representing Jurong West Secondary School. Welfare Head of Basketball for 2 years. Always cared for my team to make sure they were well and healthy. Being the best at the sport was not really my thing but I learnt to be the one who takes care of the team and keeping team morale and spirit high for important games, earning me my place as welfare head.</p>

									<p>Through basketball I have met many new people whether it be in school or outside. Many times, people I meet from pick up basketball games at the basketball court in school or at the court nearby my block are the people that I end up being close with due to a similar interest in basketball. To whoever I played basketball with in my life, I appreciate each and everyone of you.</p>
