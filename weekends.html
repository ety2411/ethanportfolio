                                <p>On Saturday afternoons, I will go for practices in church.  I play the 2nd violin for my Church ensemble, together with a few other instrumental members. On every 4th Sunday of the month, we will play for the Sunday Morning Worship Service. During special occasions, we also sometimes accompany the choir. E.g. Christmas, Good Friday, etc</p>

                                <p>Every Saturday evening we will meet for a Youth Fellowship programme. I have made many good friends there who are more senior then me. Being more mature, they support me the most during tough times, give me life advice and share personal experiences with me which comforts me in times of trouble. It is nice to know that they are there for me whenever I need them</p>

                                <p>As Cycling is often a big part of my weekend nights, it deserves its own post. I will sometimes go with school friends to cycle as a form of bonding time as well as a good form of exercise that is less tiring than basketball, it also acts as a getaway from school work and stress. The wind blowing in my face gives me a sense of freedom.</p>

                                <p>On Sundays, when I am free, I will join some friends in playing a variaty of sports such as Basketball, Netball, Badminton or Table Tennis. This is a way that I can fellowship and bond together with my church friends as I do not get to see them as often as school friends</p>
